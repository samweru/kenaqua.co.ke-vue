						<p class="card-text">Aqutab Inline (Water Purification System) is yet another mechanism to
							improve the quality of water.
							Working o the same principle as the Aquatabs flo, the
							innovative and simple device is positioned within the
							water lines of a piped system enabling the water to be
							safe when it arrives at its destination. This inexpensive
							and easy to install and use system is activated by the ow
							of water, requiring no power.
							The residual chlorine keeps the water safe even in storage.
							This is particularly appropriate for larger systems
							incorporating community water production systems.
							Each cartridge can disinfect up to 1 million litres at
							between 1 to 2ppm.</p>
