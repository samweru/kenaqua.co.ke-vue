						<p class="card-text">Aquatab Flo (Water Purification Unit) is an innovative water 		treatment system for purifying water at the
							point of collection. This community-scale, fully automated
							chlorine dosing device for shared water points in lowincome settings requires neither reliable electricity nor
							24/7 supply to function consistently. This easy to install
							and maintain system is simply activated by the ow of
							water. Manufactured in Ireland, the Aquatabs Flo is
							installed simply and inexpensively in a holding tank to
							purify thousands of litres of drinking water (up to 180,000
							litres). The unit is pre-set at 2ppm of chlorine. However,
							by simply splitting the ow of water, the dosing levels
							are further decreased, also increasing acceptability by
							reducing the chlorine taste. The residual chlorine keeps
							the water safe even in storage. However lower dosing
							does require analysis of water source; turbidity, total
							dissolved solids, pH, hardness and coliform counts.</p>
